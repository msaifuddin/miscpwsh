# Misc pwsh scripts or tools
script/tools dumping ground

## List
1. `HelpdeskTool.exe` - Created this for those that paranoid with pwsh. Search user/devices using Graph API, fast.
2. `search.ps1` - Search user/devices and view basic details, because using web UI sux and slow. Still using Graph API for faster response.
3. `helpme.ps1` - `search.ps1` on drug, with PIM roles activator and updated UI.
